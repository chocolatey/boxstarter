	About_Boxstarter_Logging

SYNOPSIS
	Describes how to the different Boxstarter Logging functions to log to 
	the console, log file or both.

DESCRIPTION
	Boxstarter provides several logging logging functions to make it easy 
	to deliver messages to script consumers and provide detailed debugging
	information to log files. Here is a description of each of these 
	functions:

	Write-BoxstarterMessage
		Writes a message to both the Boxstarter log file and to the screen. 
		These messages are output in Green to make them stand out from 
		other messages.

	Log-BoxstarterMessage
		Only writes a message to the Boxstarter log file. The message is 
		not logged to the console.

	Out-BoxtarterLog
		This is identical to Write-BoxstarterMessage but the text written 
		to the screen is not in green. It is formatted normally.

	Enter-BoxstarterLogable
		This executes a script block and redirects the standard output 
		stream and standard error stream to both the console and the 
		Boxstarter log file. This is similar to Out-Boxstarterlog but it 
		includes the output from standard command line utilities.

	Start-TimedSection and Stop-TimedSection
		These functions surround all script in between the start and end 
		functions with a header and footer message and time the script 
		execution. The footer message includes the total elapsed time. 
		These sections can be nested.
