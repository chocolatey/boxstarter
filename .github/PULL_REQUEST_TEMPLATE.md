<!--
BEFORE YOU CREATE A PULL REQUEST:

Ensure you have read over CONTRIBUTING - https://github.com/chocolatey/boxstarter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md. We provide VERY defined guidance (as such, we strongly adhere to it).

A summary of our expectations:
 - You are not submitting a pull request from your MASTER branch.
 - YOUR GIT COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have a very defined expectation for this format and are sticklers about it. Really, READ the entire [Contributing document](https://github.com/chocolatey/boxstarter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). It will save you and us pain.
 - Do not reformat code, it makes it hard to see what has changed. Leave the formatting to us.

THANKS! We appreciate you reading the entire [Contributing document](https://github.com/chocolatey/boxstarter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and not just scanning through it.
