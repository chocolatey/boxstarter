SYNOPSIS
	Describes how to use the Boxstarter TestRunner module to test 
    chocolatey package installs and publish packages that pass tests.

DESCRIPTION
	The Boxstarter TestRunner module can test chocolatey package installs 
    on one or more deployment targets and evaluate whether the installation 
    was successful. The TestRunner module can also be used to automate 
    the publishing of Chocolatey packages to a Nuget feed. That may be 
    the public chocolatey feed or a private feed.

Configuring the Local Boxstarter Repository
	Boxstarter needs to know where your repository of chocolatey packages 
    is located. The Boxstarter repository is a single directory on disk 
    that contains one subdirectory per package. By default, Boxstarter 
    maintains this directory in a directory called BuildPackages inside 
    the same root directory where the Boxstarter modules reside. All 
    Boxstarter commands that create and build packages act within this 
    directory. The repository location can be found using the $Boxstarter 
    settings variable in $Boxstarter.LocalRepo.

    This location can be changed using the Set-BoxstarterConfig command
    and its -LocalRepo parameter. By changing the location of the 
    Boxstarter repository with Set-BoxstarterConfig all future 
    interactions with the Boxstarter repository will act on this location. 
    
    To temporarily change the repository location just for the current 
    PowerShell session, one can change the value of $Boxstarter.LocalRepo 
    directly.

Configuring Boxstarter Testing Options
    Boxstarter tests Chocolatey packages by deploying and installing the 
    package to one or more deployment targets. The deployment options include 
    settings that control what computers to use to test the packages, the 
    credentials to use, VM checkpoints to restore as well as nuget feed and 
    API key for publishing successful packages. 
    
    To read the current settings for these options, use 
    Get-BoxstarterDeploymentOptions. To set these options use 
    Set-BoxstarterDeploymentOptions. This command can configure the physical
    or virtual machines used to test packages, the credential used to initiate
    connections to these targets. If targeting VMs, one may use one of the 
    Boxstarter VM providers, currently HyperV and Azure. Using these providers
    VM checkpoints can be specified so that before each test installation, the
    VM is restored to this checkpoint. If using a new VM with no checkpoints, 
    the Checkpoints will be created on the first run and then restored on 
    subsequent runs.

    In addition to configuring settings regarding the deployment targets where
    packages will be tested, a default nuget feed URL and an API Key can be
    configured. When testing an entire repository, calling Test-BoxstarterPackage
    with no parameters, the nuget feed is queried for the latest published 
    version. If the local package version is greater than the version published,
    the package install is tested. Individual packages in a Boxstarter repository 
    can be published to different feeds. The nuget feed and API Key configured
    using Set-BoxstarterDeploymentOptions are default settings used if a package 
    has not been individually assigned to its own feed.

    To assign a package to an individual feed, use Set-BoxstarterPackageNugetFeed.
    When using multiple feeds, if one needs to use the Publish-BoxstarterPackage
    command to publish the package to its feed, an API key for each feed must be 
    set. This can be accomplished by using the Set-BoxstarterFeedAPIKey.

Testing Chocolatey Packages
    Test-BoxstarterPackage can be called with an array of packages. 
    Boxstarter will build their .nupkg files and attempt to install 
    them on the deployment targets specified with 
    Set-BoxstarterDeploymentOptions. Boxstarter will use the credentials 
    provided in the deployment options. You can provide several targets to 
    Set-BoxstarterDeploymentOptions. One may wish to supply different 
    machines running different versions of windows. If a package install runs 
    to completion with no exceptions or returned error codes, Boxstarter 
    considers the install a PASSED test. If Test-BoxstarterPackage is called 
    with no packages specified, Boxstarter will iterate over each package in 
    its local repository. It will build the nupkg and compare its version to 
    the version on the package published feed. If the version in the repo 
    is greater than the published version, Boxstarter will initiate a test on 
    the deployment targets otherwise the package test will be skipped.

Publishing Successful Packages
    Test-BoxstarterPackage will return a set of test results. One can then use
    Select-BoxstarterResultsToPublish to consume these results and return the 
    package IDs of the packages who had all deployment targets pass the package 
    install. These IDs can then be passed to Publish-BoxstarterPackage to 
    publish those packages to their associated feeds.

Conserving Cloud Resources
    If the Azure Boxstarter module is used as a VM provider and any of the Azure 
    VMs are not running when the tests begin, Boxstarter will shut down each VM
    that was not initially running once the testing is completed.

Including Testing and Publishing in Continuous Integration
    The Boxstarter TestRunner can be plugged into modern Build systems and
    respond to source control commits. The Boxstarter local repo can be
    setup under a source control system like GIT, Mercurial, TFS, SVN etc.
    Build servers like TeamCity, TFS, Jenkins and others can be configured 
    to listen for changes to the Boxstarter repo. For instance, if the 
    repository is under git source control and pushed to a remote server 
    monitored by a build server, the build server can execute the Boxstarter 
    TestRunner commands to test the packages that have been changed and
    publish them to their feeds if the tests pass.

    The TestRunner module includes an Install-BoxstarterScripts command that 
    embeds a MSBuild file, a bootstrapper and a PowerShell script into a 
    repository that can run the tests and publish successful packages.

    There are two primary usage patterns for running tests from a build server:

    Dedicated Build Server
        Here, tests are run in a build environment on a server that is under 
        your direct ownership and full control. The key differentiator here is 
        that you can set your deployment options on this machine and be 
        confident that they will remain on every build from build to build.

    Hosted or Shared Build Server
        This is often a build server that you do not own or control outside of 
        your individual builds. If you set your deployment options on the server, 
        they may likely be gone on your next build. The Visual Studio Online 
        build services would land in this category.

Configuring a Dedicated Build Server
    If you administer your own build server, there is some one time setup that 
    you need to perform to integrate Boxstarter TestRunner tests and 
    automatic package publishing. This must be performed on the build machine 
    that will run the builds (a remote powershell session is acceptable). In 
    many build systems, this may be a different machine from the central server, 
    in TFS it would be the build "controller" or in TeamCity the build "agent." 
    Also, these steps must be performed using the credentials of the SAME USER 
    ACCOUNT that your build server runs under.

    1. Install the Boxstarter TestRunner module on the build machine. You can 
       use Chocolatey and run cinst Boxstarter.TestRunner or launch 
       http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/boxstarter.testrunner from IE.
    2. Although many of the deployment options are stored in a file inside the 
       repository and will be available when your build server gets the latest 
       repository code, the "secret" options are not kept in source control to 
       prevent this information from being publicly disclosed. These secrets 
       include the deployment target credentials and feed API keys. So you 
       can use Set-BoxstarterDeployOptions and Set-BoxstarterFeedAPIKey to set
       these secrets. The Credential passwords are encrypted and can only be
       unencrypted on the same build server by the same user account setting
       the options. You may also add these settings as msbuild parameters in 
       step 4 described below.
    3. If you will be performing the package test installations on Azure VMs, 
       you will need to configure your Azure subscription. Run 
         Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile 
       to download your subscription file from Azure and then 
         Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile -PublishSettingsFile `
           C:\saved\subscription\file.publishsettings.
       You may also add the Azure management key as a MSBuild parameter 
       described next.
    4. Configure the build configuration of your build server to call the 
       Boxstarter.proj MSBuild file as a step in your build. This file is 
       located in the BoxstarterScripts directory of your repo which 
       Boxstarter creates when you run Install-BoxstarterScripts. This script 
       will invoke a bootstrapper which will install everything needed for 
       the TestRunner to run including the TestRunner itself if not present. 
       On dedicated build servers, where the TestRunner is preinstalled, the 
       bootstrapper will be skipped.
       The script can take the following parameters:
         PublishSuccesfulPackages - Set this to true if you would like successful 
           packages published.
        DeploymentTargetUserName - Username to use when initiating connections 
          to the deployment targets.
        DeploymentTargetPassword - Password to use when initiating connections 
          to the deployment targets.
        FeedAPIKey - API key to use when publishing packages.
        AzureSubscriptionName - Name of the azure subscription to use when 
          using Azure VMs as deployment targets.
        AzureSubscriptionId - The Azure subscription ID Guid to use when 
          using Azure VMs as deployment targets.
        AzureSubscriptionCertificate - The Azure subscription certificate to use 
          when using Azure VMs as deployment targets. This is the Base64 encoded 
          content of the certificate and can be found in the 
          ManagementCertificate attribute of your Azure publish settings file.

        NOTE: All of these MSBuild script parameters are optional for dedicated 
        builds as long as the values were provided in steps 2 and 3 above which 
        may be preferable over having plain text parameter values fed to your 
        build.

Configuring a Hosted or Shared Build Server
    If your build server environment is shared and may be built from scratch 
    on every build then you cannot preinstall the TestRunner and configure 
    necessary settings up front. Instead the runner must be installed during 
    the build process and the settings passed via MSBuild parameters. When 
    you run Install-BoxstarterScripts on your Chocolatey repository, a 
    bootstrapper is added to your repo that can take care of installing the 
    Test Runner and its dependencies. Additionally, you can pass the following 
    MSBuild parameters to the BoxstarterBuild.proj script.

    PublishSuccesfulPackages - Set this to true if you would like successful 
        packages published.
    DeploymentTargetUserName - Username to use when initiating connections 
        to the deployment targets.
    DeploymentTargetPassword - Password to use when initiating connections 
        to the deployment targets.
    FeedAPIKey - API key to use when publishing packages.
    AzureSubscriptionName - Name of the azure subscription to use when 
        using Azure VMs as deployment targets.
    AzureSubscriptionId - The Azure subscription ID Guid to use when 
        using Azure VMs as deployment targets.
    AzureSubscriptionCertificate - The Azure subscription certificate to use 
        when using Azure VMs as deployment targets. This is the Base64 encoded 
        content of the certificate and can be found in the 
        ManagementCertificate attribute of your Azure publish settings file.
