SYNOPSIS
	Describes how to the different Boxstarter Logging functions to log to
	the console, log file or both.

DESCRIPTION
	Boxstarter provides several logging logging functions to make it easy
	to deliver messages to script consumers and provide detailed debugging
	information to log files. Here is a description of each of these
	functions:

	Write-BoxstarterMessage
		Writes a message to both the Boxstarter log file and to the screen.
		These messages are output in Green to make them stand out from
		other messages.

	Log-BoxstarterMessage
		Only writes a message to the Boxstarter log file. The message is
		not logged to the console.

	Out-BoxtarterLog
		This is identical to Write-BoxstarterMessage but the text written
		to the screen is not in green. It is formatted normally.

	Enter-BoxstarterLogable
		This executes a script block and redirects the standard output
		stream and standard error stream to both the console and the
		Boxstarter log file. This is similar to Out-Boxstarterlog but it
		includes the output from standard command line utilities.

	Start-TimedSection and Stop-TimedSection
		These functions surround all script in between the start and end
		functions with a header and footer message and time the script
		execution. The footer message includes the total elapsed time.
		These sections can be nested.
